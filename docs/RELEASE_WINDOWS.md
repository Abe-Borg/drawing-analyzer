# Releasing the Windows desktop app

This is the runbook for packaging Drawing Analyzer as a downloadable Windows app
and shipping updates to installed users. It is written to be followed
step-by-step; you don't need to remember any of it between releases.

## The big picture (no server required)

Drawing Analyzer is a **desktop app**, like VS Code. It runs entirely on the
user's PC and talks only to the Anthropic API with the user's own key. There is
**no backend to host** — no DigitalOcean droplet, no always-on service, nothing
to pay for month to month.

Two free pieces of GitHub infrastructure do all the work:

- **GitHub Actions** builds the Windows installer (you don't need a Windows
  machine).
- **GitHub Releases** hosts the installer file *and* a tiny `latest.json`
  manifest that installed apps read to discover updates.

```
  You: git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3
        │
        ▼
  GitHub Actions (windows runner)
    • PyInstaller  → dist/DrawingAnalyzer/  (the frozen app)
    • self-check   → prove the exe actually runs
    • Inno Setup   → DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe
    • make_manifest→ latest.json  (version + download URL + sha256)
        │
        ▼
  GitHub Release  v1.2.3
    • DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe   ← users download this
    • latest.json                ← installed apps poll this
        │
        ▼
  Installed apps  →  fetch releases/latest/download/latest.json  →
                     "v1.2.3 is available"  →  download + verify sha256  →  run installer
```

## Cutting a release

1. **Bump the version in both places** (a test keeps them in lockstep, so a
   mismatch fails CI):
   - `pyproject.toml` → `project.version`
   - `src/drawing_analyzer/__init__.py` → `__version__`

   Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with an optional `rcN` suffix (e.g. `1.0.0`
   or `1.0.0rc2`). A final release always supersedes its own release
   candidates.

2. **Commit** the bump on `main` (via a normal PR).

3. **Tag and push:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```
   The tag must be `v` + the exact version (`v1.2.3` for version `1.2.3`). The
   workflow refuses to publish if the tag and `pyproject.toml` disagree.

4. **Wait for the `Release (Windows installer)` workflow** to finish. It creates
   the GitHub Release with `DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe` and `latest.json`
   attached. That's it — installed apps will offer the update within a day, or
   immediately when a user clicks **Check for Updates**.

5. **(Recommended) Edit the release notes** on GitHub to describe what changed.
   The `notes` string in `latest.json` is what shows in the app's update dialog;
   by default it points users to the release page.

> **Release candidates are handled for you.** A tag with an `rcN` suffix
> (`v1.0.0rc1`) is published as a GitHub **pre-release** automatically, so GitHub
> never marks it "latest". The updater reads
> `releases/latest/download/latest.json`, which always resolves to the newest
> **full** release — so stable installs are never auto-offered a release
> candidate. Testers can still install an RC by downloading it from its release
> page directly.

## What CI validates on every PR (before you ever tag)

The same workflow runs on pull requests that touch packaging files
(`packaging/windows/**`, `release.yml`, `updates.py`, `pyproject.toml`). On a PR
the read-only `build` job builds and self-checks the app and compiles the
installer **without publishing** (only the tag-gated `publish` job can write to
the repo), and it uploads the installer as a downloadable artifact. So you can:

- confirm the Windows build still works before merging, and
- download and hand-test the actual installer from the PR's workflow run.

The self-check step runs the frozen `DrawingAnalyzer.exe --selfcheck`, which
imports the engine, the GUI toolkit, and the updater inside the frozen app. This
catches the #1 PyInstaller failure mode — a dependency that imports fine from
source but was never bundled into the exe.

## Building locally (optional)

You need a Windows machine with Python 3.11+.

```powershell
pip install -e ".[gui]" pyinstaller
pyinstaller packaging/windows/drawing-analyzer.spec --noconfirm --clean
dist\DrawingAnalyzer\DrawingAnalyzer.exe --selfcheck   # sanity check

# Then build the installer (install Inno Setup 6 first: https://jrsoftware.org/):
& "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DMyAppVersion=1.2.3 packaging\windows\installer.iss
# → dist\installer\DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe
```

## The pieces (what each file does)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `packaging/windows/app_entry.py` | The frozen app's entry point; adds `--version` / `--selfcheck` flags for CI. |
| `packaging/windows/drawing-analyzer.spec` | PyInstaller recipe. Bundles customtkinter/tkinterdnd2 assets, tiktoken's `tiktoken_ext`, and keyring's Windows backend (the imports PyInstaller can't discover on its own). |
| `packaging/windows/installer.iss` | Inno Setup script → `DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe`. Per-user install (no admin), Start-menu shortcut, clean uninstaller, closes a running instance on update. |
| `packaging/windows/make_manifest.py` | Writes `latest.json` (version, download URL, sha256). Round-tripped against the app's parser in `tests/test_updates.py`. |
| `src/drawing_analyzer/core/updates.py` | The in-app updater: fetch manifest → compare → download → verify sha256 → launch installer. Fully unit-tested, no network in tests. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Ties it together: a read-only `build` job (every relevant PR + tag) and a write-scoped, tag-only `publish` job. RC tags publish as pre-releases. |

## The code-signing situation (why users see a SmartScreen warning)

The app is shipped **unsigned** — there is no paid OS code-signing certificate.
The consequence, and *only* the consequence, is cosmetic: Windows SmartScreen
shows a **"Windows protected your PC / unrecognized app"** notice on the first
install and on each update. Users click **More info → Run anyway**. It does not
block anything.

This is a deliberate, documented trade-off, not a security hole. Note the two
*different* things both called "signing":

- **OS code-signing (skipped, the paid one)** — a certificate that makes the
  SmartScreen notice go away. ~$200–400/yr for Windows. Not used.
- **Update-integrity signing (used, free)** — the SHA-256 in `latest.json`,
  which the app verifies before running any downloaded installer. This is what
  actually protects users from a tampered download, and it costs nothing.

### If you later want to remove the SmartScreen warning

Buy an OV/EV code-signing certificate, then add a signing step to
`release.yml` after the Inno Setup compile (sign both `DrawingAnalyzer.exe`
inside the bundle and the final `DrawingAnalyzerSetup.exe` with `signtool`).
Nothing else about this pipeline has to change.

## Moving the repository

If the repo ever moves, update the owner/name in **one** place —
`GITHUB_OWNER` / `GITHUB_REPO` in `src/drawing_analyzer/core/updates.py` — and
the manifest and releases-page URLs follow. (The workflow derives URLs from
`${{ github.repository }}` automatically.)
