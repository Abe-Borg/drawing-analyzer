"""Loading and storing the Anthropic API key.

The key is searched for in the platform config directory first, then in the
executable/source-parent fallback. Returns an empty string for any
missing/unreadable file so the caller can decide how to surface that to
the user.

OS keyring (optional)
---------------------
When the ``keyring`` package is installed and a working backend is available,
the keyring is consulted *first* — keychain / credential-manager / kwallet
secrets are at least as safe as a plaintext file and survive a stray
``cat`` / scp of the config directory. The plaintext file remains a
fallback so the legacy "drop a key file next to the exe" workflow keeps
working unchanged and existing users are never locked out of their saved
key when they upgrade.

File permissions
----------------
On POSIX, :func:`load_api_key_from_file` lazily tightens the permissions of
any fallback file it can read to ``0600`` (owner read+write only) so an
in-place upgrade improves the existing key file's posture without
requiring the user to re-enter the key.
