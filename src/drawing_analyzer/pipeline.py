"""Orchestration: drawing PDFs -> per-sheet vision digests -> combined text.

This is the public entry point for the drawing subsystem. It flattens the given
PDFs into sheets (one per page), renders and digests each sheet independently,
and concatenates the per-sheet digests into a single text artifact ready to be
spliced into the spec reviewer's Project Context.

Rendering (PyMuPDF) runs sequentially on the calling thread — it is fast and the
PDF backend is not thread-safe to share — while the slow, independent per-sheet
*digest* (one vision call each) runs on a bounded thread pool, so a large set
completes in roughly ``1/workers`` of the wall-clock. Results are reassembled in
page order, so the combined digest and every total are deterministic regardless
of completion order.

    ``progress`` (if given) is invoked as ``progress(done, total, label)`` as
    each sheet finishes and once at completion, so a GUI can show "k/n".
    ``client`` is injectable for tests. Per-sheet failures are captured on the
    returned :class:`DrawingContext` (``errors`` and the failing sheet's
    ``SheetDigest.error``); they never abort the run.

    Digest caching is opt-in: pass an explicit ``cache``
    (:class:`~drawing_analyzer.digest_cache.DigestCache`), or ``use_cache=True`` to
    use the process-wide persistent cache, so an unchanged sheet on a re-run is
    served without a new vision call. Left off, the engine behaves exactly as
    before (hermetic tests never touch the on-disk cache).

    Digests run concurrently on up to ``max_workers`` threads (default
    :data:`DEFAULT_DIGEST_WORKERS`, or ``DRAWING_ANALYZER_MAX_WORKERS``);
    rendering stays sequential. Sheets are reassembled in page order, so the
    output is independent of completion order. ``max_workers=1`` forces fully
    sequential processing.

    ``synthesize=True`` runs one extra text-only pass after the digests that
    reconciles them into a "Drawing Set Overview" (cross-sheet references /
    conflicts), prepended to ``combined_text`` and exposed on
    ``DrawingContext.synthesis_text``. It is skipped for <2 readable sheets and
    falls back to the plain per-sheet digests on failure (the failure is
    recorded in ``errors``). ``synthesis_model`` overrides the synthesis model.

    ``use_batch=True`` digests every (uncached) sheet through the Message
    Batches API instead of the per-sheet real-time pool — 50% cheaper, and each
    sheet's images ride as Files-API ``file_id`` references so no request body
    approaches the 32 MB Messages-API limit (the failure the inline-base64 path
    hit on dense sheets). The batch is polled to completion on the calling
    thread; the cross-sheet synthesis still runs as one synchronous text-only
    call afterward. Caching, page ordering, and per-sheet error capture behave
    identically to the real-time path.
