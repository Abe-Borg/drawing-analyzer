## [Unreleased]

### Exhaustive QC — the critique pass

Part II of the QC work: make the markup read like an experienced engineer's
review, not the digest's incidental noticing.

#### Added

- **Critique pass (`critique=True`) — "the reviewer".** A second full-coverage
  vision read per sheet (the same overview + tiles + text layer the digest sees),
  under a senior-QA-engineer persona whose only job is to find problems: errors,
  code concerns (cited conservatively), RFI-worthy ambiguities, internal
  inconsistencies, stale/copy-paste text, and **absences** — content a complete
  sheet should show but doesn't (`anchor_hint: "SHEET"`, no quote). It emits only
  the findings block, so the prose digest and `combined_text` are untouched (I-2).
- **Self-consistency.** The critique runs twice; a finding both reads surface is
  corroborated (`reproduced`), a singleton is kept but flagged. The merge
  deduplicates by anchor-rect overlap (IoU) once anchored, else the reported tile,
  and by normalized-text overlap. Digest and critique findings then pool into one
  per-sheet set before anchoring — cross-source agreement also marks `reproduced`.
  The flag is a soft confidence signal; it never suppresses a finding.
- **`Finding` gains `anchor_hint` and `reproduced`** (both optional, backward-
  compatible — read tolerantly from cache, no cache invalidation) and the critique
  is cached under its own key (a distinct namespace from the digest).
- **Cross-sheet QC pass (`cross_qc=True`).** A deliberate whole-set conflict
  hunt — one text-only reasoning call over all the digests + text layers (no
  images; large sets shard by discipline) that finds conflicts *between* sheets:
  the same tag valued two ways, twin notes diverged, a note contradicted
  elsewhere, a cross-reference whose target disclaims the pointer's claim.
  Distinct from the prose synthesis (untouched); `combined_text` never sees it
  (I-2). Findings carry **dual anchors** — a primary plus `also_on` legs resolved
  to their own sheets via the set's title-block ids — so the markup writer clouds
  **both** sheets of a conflict, each popup cross-referencing the other. `Finding`
  gains a backward-compatible `also_on`; the anchor resolver, markup writer,
  verification pass, and pipeline gained additive dual-leg support (a finding with
  no legs is unchanged). Cross-sheet findings are verified with a **dual-crop**
  pass — one crop per sheet in a single call — so a conflict can reach `VERIFIED`
  and cloud under the default verified-only gating (a single-sheet crop could only
  ever say NOT_VISIBLE).
- **Review profiles (`profiles=[…]`).** The owner's QC knowledge as versioned,
  injectable Markdown checklists: each profile's items are appended to the
  critique prompt ("APPLY THIS REVIEW CHECKLIST EXPLICITLY, ITEM BY ITEM"), so the
  reviewer applies encoded checks deliberately, not incidentally. Profiles load
  from the package's built-in set and from `~/.drawing_analyzer/profiles/`
  (override `DRAWING_ANALYZER_PROFILES_DIR`; a user file wins over a built-in by
  reusing its `name`). The selected profiles' fingerprint (name + version +
  content hash) folds into the critique cache key, so editing a checklist
  re-critiques; a very long checklist is split across the self-consistency runs
  rather than truncated. A starter **fire-protection** (NFPA 13) profile ships,
  and `profiles.suggest_profiles(sheet_ids)` proposes profiles by discipline.

### QC findings, verification & markup integration

Turns the analyzer from a pure coverage instrument into one that also
*proposes, verifies, and marks up* discrete review findings — **coverage
proposes, precision disposes.** Everything below is additive and off by default;
a plain digest run is byte-for-byte what it was before, and the prose digest that
feeds the downstream spec reviewer is never touched.

#### Added

- **Vector text-layer grounding.** Each sheet's `page.get_text()` text layer is
  lifted losslessly and sent verbatim in the digest prompt, ahead of the images,
  as the source of truth for exact strings (tags, schedule values, note numbers,
  sheet references) — the antidote to the OCR-of-raster digit errors that vector
  text can't make.
- **Structured findings.** The digest model additionally emits a machine-readable
  `findings` JSON block (category / severity / text / verbatim `source_quote` /
  tile / refs), parsed out of the response by a tolerant parser without
  disturbing the prose. Findings are cached alongside the digest.
- **Reference audit** (`reference_audit=True`, or the GUI **Reference audit**
  checkbox) — a deterministic, zero-API pass over the text layers that learns the
  set's own sheet-ID grammar and flags stale / missing / malformed
  cross-references, each anchored to its exact word rectangle with a closest-in-set
  suggestion. It never claims a sheet "doesn't exist," only that it "isn't in the
  provided set."
- **Anchor resolver.** Maps each finding's `source_quote` back to a rectangle on
  its page (EXACT / FUZZY / TILE / UNANCHORED tiers), offline and PDF-engine-free;
  an unmatched non-empty quote is the hallucination signal and is never clouded by
  default.
- **Verification pass.** For each anchored model finding, renders a high-DPI crop
  and asks one small Opus call whether the finding holds *in that crop*, mapping
  to VERIFIED / REJECTED / UNCERTAIN; the crop is written to
  `evidence/<finding_id>.png` regardless of verdict. Additive and non-fatal.
- **Reviewed PDFs + findings CSV** (`qc_markups=True`, or the GUI **QC Markups**
  checkbox) — a `<stem>_reviewed.pdf` per source PDF with real revision-cloud
  annotations (severity-colored, authored *"Drawing Analyzer (AI review)"*,
  populating Bluebeam Revu's Markups List), plus a Windows-Excel-friendly
  `findings.csv` (UTF-8 BOM, CRLF). VERIFIED + DETERMINISTIC findings are clouded
  by default; the original source PDF is never modified.
- **Folder-export QC inventory** — `findings.json`, `findings.csv`,
  `sheet_text/<sheet>.txt` per sheet, and `evidence/<finding_id>.png` crops
  written alongside the existing report / Markdown, plus the reviewed PDFs.
- **HTML report findings.** A pinned, sortable **QC Findings** card with
  color-coded status chips (Verified / Deterministic / Uncertain / Unanchored /
  Rejected); a per-sheet raw text-layer block that now feeds the report's
  full-text search; and a **Raster** badge on empty-text-layer sheets.
- **Performance.** A two-level digest cache that recognizes an unchanged sheet
  *before* rendering — skipping ~4.5 s/sheet of rasterization on a cached re-run —
  and a bounded parallel Files-API upload pool
  (`DRAWING_ANALYZER_UPLOAD_WORKERS`, default 6).
- **Hermetic acceptance suite** (`tests/test_drawing_acceptance.py`) encoding the
  end-to-end acceptance script: a fresh both-checkbox run, the reviewed-PDF
  appearance-stream guarantee, the stale-reference closest-match suggestion, a
  zero-digest-API cached re-run with identical outputs, and the raster fallback.

#### Changed

- **Render target 1992 px → 1560 px** per tile for ordinary vector sheets, now
  that the text layer carries the exact strings — cutting PNG bytes and image
  tokens ~40%. A sheet with an *empty* text layer (scanned / pasted raster) still
  renders at 1992 px, where the pixels are the only information channel.
- **Strict blank-tile suppression.** Only provably pixel-uniform tiles are
  dropped, and the omission is disclosed to the model. An opt-in near-blank
  heuristic (`DRAWING_ANALYZER_SUPPRESS_NEAR_BLANK`) defaults off.
- **Digest cache schema and prompt versions bumped.** The render-target change,
  the text-layer block, the findings block, and the two-level key each invalidate
  prior cache entries once; the first run after upgrading re-digests every sheet,
  then caches as before.
- **API facts re-verified** against the current Anthropic docs
  (`platform.claude.com`, 2026-07). The vision per-image caps (Opus 4.8 = 4784
  tokens / 2576 px), the >20-image 2000 px hard-reject rule, the 32 MB request-size
  limit, and the ~50% Message Batches discount all still hold, so **no `tiling.py`
  constant changed**; only the docstring's section citation ("General limits" →
  "Request limits") and the token estimator's hi-res-roster note were refreshed.
  (The high-resolution vision tier has since grown beyond Opus; the estimator
  intentionally keys the hi-res tier off the Opus whitelist, which is exact for
  this Opus-only tool and a safe under-estimate for anything else.)

#### Security

- **The API key is no longer embedded in the HTML report by default.** The
  in-report Ask-AI assistant prompts for a key on first use and keeps it only in
  the browser tab's `sessionStorage`, so the report file is safe to share. The old
  behavior is opt-in (`embed_api_key=True`, or a GUI checkbox) and stamps the
  report with a red *"don't share this file"* warning.

#### Isolation

- PyMuPDF (AGPL-3.0) imports remain confined to named modules: `render.py`
  (rasterizing sheets and crops) and now `annotate.py` (writing cloud annotations
  onto reviewed PDFs). No other module imports the PDF backend, so it can be
  swapped for a permissively-licensed one by rewriting just those two files.
